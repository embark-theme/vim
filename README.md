## Getting Started

> At this time only terminals supporting truecolors will work. Make sure you have `set termguicolors` in your vimrc

First install using your plugin manager. Rename package to embark using your plugin manager's built in facilities to do so.

### packer.nvim
```lua
use { 'embark-theme/vim', as = 'embark' }
```

### vim-plug
```vim
Plug 'embark-theme/vim', { 'as': 'embark', 'branch': 'main' }
```

Then set embark as colorsheme.

Vimscript

```vim
colorscheme embark
```

Lua for neovim

```lua
vim.cmd('colorsheme embark')
```

For packer users the colorsheme can be placed in the config callback.

```lua
use {
  'embark-theme/vim',
  as = 'embark',
  config = function()
    vim.cmd('colorsheme embark')
  end
}
```

### Lightline support

A lightline theme is also available. Just set your colorscheme to embark.

```vim
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'embark',
      \ }
```

### Airline support

Airline should just pick up on theme automatically, but if there is an issue with this it can be set manually.
`let g:airline_theme = 'embark'`

## Configuration

Embark offers a few configuration values to control features. Setting values to `1` will turn the feature on.

Italics - Make sure your terminal is set up to handle them. See [this](https://medium.com/@dubistkomisch/how-to-actually-get-italics-and-true-colour-to-work-in-iterm-tmux-vim-9ebe55ebc2be) for help getting italics and true color working in your terminal.

`let g:embark_terminal_italics = 1`
